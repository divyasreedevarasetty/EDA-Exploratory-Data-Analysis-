# EDA-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-

This project conducts an  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a comprehensive hotel booking dataset using Python. The primary aim is to uncover crucial insights into booking patterns, customer behavior, and the key factors that influence hotel reservations and cancellations. Through this analysis, we identify trends such as hotel type popularity, seasonal booking variations, and significant predictors of cancellations like lead time and the frequency of booking modifications, providing actionable intelligence for optimizing hotel operations and strategies.
